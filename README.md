# FoodOrderApp


<h1> The Order App is a user-friendly application that allows you to add and remove meal items from your cart. As you add or remove items, the total cost in the cart is automatically updated to reflect the changes. <h1>

  <h3>Features</h3>
  </br>
  <ul>
<li>Add and remove meal items from the cart</li>
<li>Automatic adjustment of the total cost in real-time</li>
  </ul>  
    </br>
<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
<p>The Order App is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages various React concepts and features to provide a seamless user experience.</p>
  </br>
<h3>React Components</h3>
<p>The app employs a proper breakdown of React components, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase. By dividing the UI into smaller reusable components, the app becomes easier to understand and extend.</p>
  </br>
<h3>Context, Props, and Refs/Forward Refs</h3>
<p>To efficiently pass data between components, the app utilizes React's Context, Props, and Refs/Forward Refs. Context allows for global state management, ensuring data is accessible across multiple components. Props facilitate the transfer of data from parent components to child components. Refs/Forward Refs enable accessing and manipulating DOM elements directly. </p>

<h3>State Management</h3>
<p>The Order App effectively manages state using React's state management capabilities. By updating and tracking the state of the order modal and buttons, the app ensures the user interface responds appropriately when clicked.</p>

<h3>useEffect</h3>
<p>The app employs the useEffect hook, a feature of React, to control component rendering at the appropriate time. By specifying dependencies, useEffect ensures that components update only when necessary, optimizing performance.</p>
